###  About

O seguinte algoritmo é de busca e otimização baseada em bio-inspiração no ser vivo Alga e segue o padrão dos algoritmos de inteligência artificial desse segmento onde possuem as seguintes características:

```
1 Cria-se os candidatos à solução
2 Avalia-se os candidatos
3 Permite a adaptação com base nos melhores
4 Seleciona-se os que serão substituídos
5 Cria nova geração/grupo e volta ao passo 2 até alcançar a condição de parada.
```

### About Seaweed

![](https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2017/seaweedfuele.jpg)

Seaweed is the common name for a diverse polyphyletic grouping of photosynthetic organisms whose life cycle is generally complete in the aquatic environment.

About 90 percent of the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere is estimated to be generated by planktonic algae photosynthesis.

Algae, both unicellular and multicellular, have asexual and sexual reproduction. In unicellular algae asexual reproduction occurs by binary division, with one individual giving rise to two others. In the case of multicellular algae, this type of reproduction can occur by stem fragmentation, as is common with filamentous algae, or by zoospore. In this process, an individual forms flagellate cells called zoospores that detach and, when fixed on some substrate, give rise to new individuals.

Many species of algae are unicellular beings, living free in the water and moving with the aid of flagella or amoeboid movement. Some species have no movement of their own and occur in the environment either in coccoid form (coccus, the simplest type of bacteria) or in mucoid-covered capsoid form. However, even unicellular algae can sometimes be grouped into colonial forms, mobile or not.

### Problema

Algae are arranged in a <strong> (Ocean) </strong> search space and must solve a N-size sudoku

As algas se movimentam para os pontos de produção de nutrientes no espaço de busca a partir das funções <strong> search_nutrients </strong> e <strong> ocean_localization </strong>.

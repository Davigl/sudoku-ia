<h2>
Problem
</h2>

Seaweeds are arranged at a <strong> (Ocean) </strong> search space and they **must solve a N-size sudoku**.

<h2>
About the Algorithm
</h2>

Search and optimization algorithm with bio-inspiration in seaweed (genetic algorithm). This algorithm follow these steps to get a solution.

```
1 Create Candidates (Seaweeds);
2 Seaweeds are evaluated by oxygen production;
3 Allows adaptation based on the best (fragmentation, binary division);
4 Select the ones to replace;
5 Create new generation / group and return to step 2 until the stop condition is reached.
```

<h2>
Running the Script
</h2>

Set sudoku size by editing **ocean.rb** and **oxygen.rb**, then run.

```bash
ruby ocean.rb
```

Seaweed is the common name for a diverse polyphyletic grouping of photosynthetic organisms whose life cycle is generally complete in the aquatic environment.

About 90 percent of the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere is estimated to be generated by planktonic algae photosynthesis.

Algae, both unicellular and multicellular, have asexual and sexual reproduction. In unicellular algae asexual reproduction occurs by binary division, with one individual giving rise to two others. In the case of multicellular algae, this type of reproduction can occur by stem fragmentation, as is common with filamentous algae, or by zoospore. In this process, an individual forms flagellate cells called zoospores that detach and, when fixed on some substrate, give rise to new individuals.

Many species of algae are unicellular beings, living free in the water and moving with the aid of flagella or amoeboid movement. Some species have no movement of their own and occur in the environment either in coccoid form (coccus, the simplest type of bacteria) or in mucoid-covered capsoid form. However, even unicellular algae can sometimes be grouped into colonial forms, mobile or not.
